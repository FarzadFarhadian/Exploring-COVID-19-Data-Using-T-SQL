# Exploring-COVID-19-Data-Using-T-SQL

This project explores COVID-19 data related to deaths and vaccinations using T-SQL. The data was obtained from a public dataset and was processed using Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio.

The project includes several tasks, such as changing data types, calculating the percentage of the population that contracted COVID-19, and identifying countries with the highest number of deaths. The project also utilizes common table expressions (CTEs) and temporary tables to organize and manipulate the data.

The main goal of this project is to provide insights into the impact of COVID-19 on different countries and to demonstrate how T-SQL can be used to explore and analyze large datasets. The code and results of the project can be found in this repository.
